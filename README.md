# List of required software for the course

1. To be able to work on projects in teams or to be able to stay synchronized with the course material (sample code, software, etc.) you  need to creat a github account (github.com) (just like the instructors account). Then you can download and isntall the github desktop app (https://desktop.github.com). More about this later.

2. The Netbeans IDE 8.1. You can download and install the version that comes with JDK 8 or install JDK in a standalone fashion. (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)
Netbeans comes with SOA modules (for creation and deployment of Web services).

3. Netbeans comes with Glassfish server by default, but you can configure it with other servers. For example Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org). You can download apache tomcat as a zipped folder and extrat it. Then you can configure netbeans to use it from that folder.

# XML/JSON data representation/parsing
